# zug

**zug** is a simple Rust command-line utility for encrypting and decrypting files using AES-256-GCM-SIV encryption.

The project derives its name from the Swiss canton of *Zug*. Switzerland being one of the countries with the strongest privacy laws on earth. üá®üá≠üèîÔ∏è

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt files using a password-derived 256-bit key (SHA-256 hashed).
- Embeds optional hints in encrypted files.
- Uses AES-256-GCM-SIV for encryption.
---

## Usage

File encryption.
```bash
zug -e <password> <path> [hint]
```
File decryption.
```bash
zug -d <password> <path>
```
Display file hint.
```bash
zug -h <path>
```

- `<password>` : Password used for encryption/decryption.
- `<path>` : Path to the file to encrypt.
- `[hint]` : (OPTIONAL) Embed a hint in the encrypted file.

---

## Example

```bash
zug -e "VerySecurePassword" ./my-file.txt
```

---

## Internals

- **Key Derivation**: Uses SHA-256 to hash the password into a 256-bit key.
- **Encryption Format**:
  ```
  [1-byte hint length][hint bytes][12-byte IV][encrypted data]
  ```
- **Cryptography**: Uses the `aes-gcm_siv` crate for AES-256-GCM-SIV encryption.

---

## Future Improvements

- Support for streaming large files.
