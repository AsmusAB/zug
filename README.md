# zug

**zug** is a simple Rust command-line utility for encrypting and decrypting files using AES-256-GCM-SIV encryption.

The project derives its name from the Swiss canton of *Zug*. Switzerland being one of the countries with the strongest privacy laws on earth. üá®üá≠üèîÔ∏è

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt files using a password-derived 256-bit key (SHA-256 hashed).
- Embed optional human-readable hints in encrypted files.
- Secure, chunked streaming encryption with AES-256-GCM-SIV.
- Authentication on every encrypted block.
---

## Usage

Encrypt a file.
```bash
zug -e <password> -h [hint] <path>
```
Decrypt a file.
```bash
zug -d <password> <path>
```
Display file hint.
```bash
zug -h <path>
```

- `<password>` : Password used for encryption/decryption.
- `<path>` : Path to the file to encrypt.
- `[hint]` : (OPTIONAL) Embed a hint in the encrypted file.

## Example

```bash
zug -e "VerySecurePassword" -h "my hint" my-file.txt
```

## Internals

- Key Derivation:
  Passwords are hashed with SHA-256 to produce a 256-bit key.

- Encryption Format:
  The encrypted file is structured as follows:

      [1-byte hint length]
      [hint bytes]

      For each block:
          [12-byte random nonce]
          [4-byte ciphertext length (little endian)]
          [ciphertext (<= 64 KiB + 16-byte authentication tag)]

- Streaming:
  Files are encrypted and decrypted in 64 KiB blocks.
  Each block uses its own random nonce and authentication tag, ensuring integrity.

- Cryptography:
  Built on the aes-gcm-siv crate for AES-256-GCM-SIV encryption.
